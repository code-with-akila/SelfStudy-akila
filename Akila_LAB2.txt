1. WAP for creating a mini calculator for performing a particular operation based on user choice. ex. if the user will select the addition operation then the output should be the addition of the given two nos.

package demo;
import java.util.*;
public class Mini_Calculator {

	public static void main(String[] args) {
	    Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);  //creating object for scanner class
		
	    System.out.println("Welcome to the Mini Calculator!");
	    System.out.println("Enter two numbers:");  //it will give the message to the user
	    
	    double num1 = sc.nextDouble();  
	    double num2 = sc.nextDouble();
	    double result; 
	    
	    //Addition
	    result=num1+num2;
	    System.out.println("Addition of : "+result);
	    
	    //Substraction
	    result=num1-num2;
	    System.out.println("Substraction of : "+result);
	    
	    //Multiplication
	    result=num1*num2;
	    System.out.println("Multiplication of : "+result);
	    
	    //Division
	    result=num1/num2;
	    System.out.println("Division of : "+result);
	    
	    //Modulus
	    result=num1%num2;
	    System.out.println("Modulus of : "+result);
	}
}

##Output
Welcome to the Mini Calculator!
Enter two numbers:
8
2
Addition of : 10.0
Substraction of : 6.0
Multiplication of : 16.0
Division of : 4.0
Modulus of : 0.0


2. WAP for creating a banking Application .you have to take input from the user whether the user wants to deposit, withdraw, or find a current balance.

package demo;
import java.util.*;
public class BankingApplication 
{
    public static void main(String[] args) 
    {
        Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
        double balance = 0; //here first we set initial balance as 0

        System.out.println("Welcome to the Banking Application!");
        boolean exit = false; //used for should not exit initially

        while (!exit) //keep running while exit is NOT true and !exit condition checks if exit is false means true
        {
            System.out.println("\nChoose an option:");
            System.out.println("1. Deposit");
            System.out.println("2. Withdraw");
            System.out.println("3. Check Balance");
            System.out.println("4. Exit");
            int choice = sc.nextInt();

            switch (choice) 
            {
                case 1: //for deposit purpose
                    System.out.print("Enter the amount to deposit: ");
                    double depositAmount = sc.nextDouble();
                    balance = balance + depositAmount;
                    System.out.println("Successfully deposited! Current balance: " + balance);
                    break;
                    
                case 2: //for withdraw purpose
                    System.out.print("Enter the amount to withdraw: ");
                    double withdrawAmount = sc.nextDouble();
                    if (withdrawAmount <= balance) 
                    {
                        balance = balance - withdrawAmount;
                        System.out.println("Successfully withdrawn! Current balance: " + balance);
                    } 
                    else 
                    {
                        System.out.println("Insufficient balance!");
                    }
                    break;
                    
                case 3: //check current balance
                    System.out.println("Your current balance is: " + balance);
                    break;
                    
                case 4: //end
                    System.out.println("Thank you for using the Banking Application!");
                    exit = true;
                    break;
                    
                default:
                    System.out.println("Invalid choice! Please try again.");
            }
        }

        sc.close(); //it will close because it stop the memory allocation for user input or 
        			//If you donâ€™t close the Scanner, it might waste memory
    }
}
