1.  Write a  java program for Exception Handling using throw keyword.

package com.lab;

public class ThrowExample 
{
    public static void checkAge(int age)		// Method to check voting eligibility
    {
        if (age < 18) 
        {
            throw new ArithmeticException("Not eligible to vote. Age must be 18 or above.");		// Throwing an exception if age is less than 18
        } 
        else 
        {
            System.out.println("You are eligible to vote.");
        }
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) 
    {
        System.out.println("Checking voting eligibility...");

        try 
        {
            checkAge(16); 	// This will throw an exception
        } 
        catch (ArithmeticException e) 
        {
            System.out.println("Exception caught: " + e.getMessage());
        }

        checkAge(20); 	// This will not throw an exception
    }
}

##output
Checking voting eligibility...
Exception caught: Not eligible to vote. Age must be 18 or above.
You are eligible to vote.


2. Create two thread.one thread is finding average of first 50 numbers and other thread is printing square of number store in array arr={10,15,20,25,30}

package com.lab;

class AverageThread extends Thread		//Class for finding the average of the first 50 numbers
{
	 public void run() 
	 {
	     int sum = 0;
	     for (int i = 1; i <= 50; i++) 
	     {
	         sum += i;
	     }
	     double average = (double) sum / 50;
	     System.out.println("Average of first 50 numbers: " + average);
	 }
}

class SquareThread extends Thread		//Class for printing the square of numbers in the array 
{
	 public void run() 
	 {
	     int[] arr = {10, 15, 20, 25, 30};
	     for (int num : arr) 
	     {
	         System.out.println("Square of " + num + " is: " + (num * num));
	     }
	 }
}

public class MultiThreadExample 
{
	 public static void main(String[] args) 
	 {
		 // Creating objects for both threads
	     AverageThread t1 = new AverageThread();
	     SquareThread t2 = new SquareThread();
	
	     // Starting both threads
	     t1.start();
	     t2.start();
	 }
}

##output
Average of first 50 numbers: 25.5
Square of 10 is: 100
Square of 15 is: 225
Square of 20 is: 400
Square of 25 is: 625
Square of 30 is: 900
