1 . Assign and print the roll number, phone number and address of two students having names "Sam" and "John" respectively by creating two objects of class 'Student'.

package com.lab;

public class Student 
{
    int rollNumber;
    String phoneNumber;
    String address;

    // Constructor to initialize the values
    Student(int rollNumber, String phoneNumber, String address) 
    {
        this.rollNumber = rollNumber;
        this.phoneNumber = phoneNumber;
        this.address = address;
    }

    // Method to display student details
    void displayStudentDetails() 
    {
        System.out.println("Roll Number: " + rollNumber);
        System.out.println("Phone Number: " + phoneNumber);
        System.out.println("Address: " + address);
    }
    
    public static void main(String[] args) 
    {
        // Creating objects for two students
        Student student1 = new Student(101, "1234567890", "123 Street, City");
        Student student2 = new Student(102, "0987654321", "456 road, Town");

        // Printing the details of students
        System.out.println("Student 1 Details:");
        student1.displayStudentDetails();
        
        System.out.println("\nStudent 2 Details:");
        student2.displayStudentDetails();
    }
}

##output
Student 1 Details:
Roll Number: 101
Phone Number: 1234567890
Address: 123 Street, City

Student 2 Details:
Roll Number: 102
Phone Number: 0987654321
Address: 456 road, Town


2. Print the average of three numbers entered by user by creating a class named 'Average' having a method to calculate and print the average.

package com.lab;
import java.util.Scanner;

public class Average 
{
    // Method to calculate and print the average
    void calculateAverage(int num1, int num2, int num3) 
    {
        double average = (num1 + num2 + num3) / 3.0;
        System.out.println("The average of the three numbers is: " + average);
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) 
    {
        // Creating object of Average class
        Average avg = new Average();

        // Taking user input for three numbers
        Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);
        
        System.out.print("Enter first number: ");
        int num1 = scanner.nextInt();
        
        System.out.print("Enter second number: ");
        int num2 = scanner.nextInt();
        
        System.out.print("Enter third number: ");
        int num3 = scanner.nextInt();

        // Calling the method to calculate and display the average
        avg.calculateAverage(num1, num2, num3);
    }
}

##output
Enter first number: 20
Enter second number: 40
Enter third number: 30
The average of the three numbers is: 30.0
